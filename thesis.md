## Abstract

## Introduction
Very boring but important
In this part, the background will be explained!
We will have a lot of stuff here:

Antibiotic resistance is fueling a growing global health crisis, necessitating the discovery of antibacterial compounds with
novel modes of action (MoAs). The decline in new antibiotic approvals, coupled with the rise of multi-resistant pathogens,
highlights the limitations of traditional antibiotic drug discovery. Among them, phenotypic drug screening has proven effective 
at identifying antibacterial compounds, but requires time-consuming follow-up experiments to determine drug MoA or targets. 
Here, we will outline a project aiming to develop a streamlined workflow for predicting antibiotic MoAs from automated microscopy
imaging data analyzed by deep learning. The project is based on the hypothesis that MoAs of chemical compounds can be predicted 
by computationally matching their induced phenotypes to those of genetic mutants. In order to map the phenotypes of essential 
genes, we use a CRISPRi technique allowing to induce their repression in a finely tuned manner. We will report on our early 
efforts to create and phenotype these inducible mutants in E. coli. This work contributes to the establishment of a pipeline that 
will accelerate the search for novel antibiotics against antimicrobial resistant bacteria.
